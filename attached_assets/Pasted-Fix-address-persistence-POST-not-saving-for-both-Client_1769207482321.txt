Fix address persistence (POST not saving) for both Clients and Carriers.

Current behavior:
- Adding an address from /clients/:id or /carriers/:id shows success UI but no address is saved.
- GET /api/companies/:id/addresses and GET /api/carriers/:id/addresses always return [].

Goal:
- POST endpoints must persist addresses in DB and return created row.
- Frontend must show backend errors (no silent failures).
- After POST success, refetch GET and show saved address.

Backend: audit + fix routes

1) Locate the backend handlers for:
- POST /api/companies/:id/addresses
- POST /api/carriers/:id/addresses
- GET  /api/companies/:id/addresses
- GET  /api/carriers/:id/addresses

2) Ensure correct FK assignment:
- For companies: insert must set addresses.companyId = Number(req.params.id)
- For carriers:  insert must set addresses.carrierId = Number(req.params.id)
Do not rely on req.body.companyId/carrierId.

3) Ensure required fields are handled:
- addresses.country exists in DB. If req.body.country is missing/empty, default "BR".
- Also trim string fields and allow nulls for optional fields safely.

4) Add defensive validation:
- If id is NaN or <= 0, return 400.
- If body missing required address fields (street/city/state/zip), return 400 with JSON error.

5) Make sure the insert returns created row:
- Return 201 with created address JSON.
- If error occurs, return 500 with error message and console.error stack.

Database: enforce default + backfill

6) Run SQL migration automatically at startup OR via drizzle/sql:
- ALTER TABLE addresses ALTER COLUMN country SET DEFAULT 'BR';
- UPDATE addresses SET country='BR' WHERE country IS NULL;

Also verify addresses table has correct columns: street, number, neighborhood, city, state, zip, country, company_id, carrier_id (or correct naming per schema).

Frontend: stop silent failure + refetch

7) In AddressesSection (client and carrier pages):
- On addAddress, if fetch returns !ok, read response text/json and show toast error.
- Only show success toast after 200/201.
- After success, call refetchAddresses() and update list.

Testing

8) Add a test script or manual test instructions:
- Create address via curl:
  POST /api/companies/1/addresses with JSON body
  POST /api/carriers/1/addresses with JSON body
- Confirm GET returns at least 1 row.
- Confirm UI shows the new address and it persists after refresh.

Constraint:
- Do NOT add new features. Only fix persistence, error handling, and correct API wiring.
