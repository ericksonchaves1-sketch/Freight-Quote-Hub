Fix addresses rendering and persistence for Clients and Carriers.

Context:
Currently:
- On Edit Client page, the Addresses section is missing (form and list not rendering).
- On Edit Carrier page, only the form renders, but previously saved addresses are not listed.

Goal:
On /clients/:id and /carriers/:id:
- Always render the Addresses block (form + list).
- Load and display saved addresses from backend.
- Allow adding an address and immediately refresh the list.

Frontend Tasks:

1. Ensure the Addresses component is rendered:
- In client edit page JSX, make sure <AddressesSection /> (or equivalent) is always mounted.
- In carrier edit page JSX, ensure both form and list are rendered.

2. Conditional behavior:
- If no id exists (new record):
  - Show the Addresses block.
  - Disable the "Add Address" button.
  - Display message: "Save the record before adding addresses."

- If id exists:
  - Enable add button.
  - Fetch and display addresses.

3. Data loading:
On page load when id exists:
- Fetch:
  GET /api/companies/:id/addresses → setAddresses([])
  GET /api/carriers/:id/addresses → setAddresses([])

- Render the list above the form.
- If empty, show: "No addresses registered yet."

4. Add address action:
On clicking "Add Address":
- POST to:
  /api/companies/:id/addresses OR /api/carriers/:id/addresses
- On success:
  - Clear form fields.
  - Refetch GET to refresh list.

Backend Tasks:

Ensure the following endpoints exist and function correctly:

GET  /api/companies/:id/addresses
POST /api/companies/:id/addresses

GET  /api/carriers/:id/addresses
POST /api/carriers/:id/addresses

- Must return JSON array.
- Ensure proper FK relationships.

Testing:

1. Open /clients/1:
- Form and list must render.
- Add address → must appear immediately and persist after refresh.

2. Repeat for /carriers/:id.

Constraints:
- Do NOT add new features.
- Only fix rendering, loading, and persistence of addresses.
